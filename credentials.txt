A 6th TA has sent me their ENCS username. I repeat my instructions...

I have received the ENCS usernames of 6 TA/lab instructors. I have
placed you all in the same group just as students are given. If you
want to create tables and you do not want to disturb the work of the
other TAs then you should prpend or append your initials to the
tables you create/use.

Here are the instructions I send to the students:

The ENCS usernames in this group are

   k_mdshak,p_jaybha,pa_pal,ji_meht,ju_atel,p_shahin

You have been given the "group account" cac353_4 to do your project work
for this course. "group accounts" are needed so that you can share files
with your partners easily.

2 email aliases have been setup for your group. Sending email to either
cac353_4@encs.concordia.ca or ca_comp353_4@encs.concordia.ca will send email
to each one of you.

Though you have a group account you do not have to login to it. You have
been added to the "cac353_4" linux group and you can write in the following
directories:


    /groups/c/ca_comp353_4       This directory is where you should cd into
                                 and use while working on the project.
                                 It is *NOT* available on the web server!


    /www/groups/c/ca_comp353_4   This is the directory where you should place
                                 *ALL* the files to be viewable on the web.


You as a user do not have any disk quota on the above directories but the
linux group "cac353_4" does. The above directories have the sgid bit set
(the 's' in 'rws' below) which means that any files or directories created
below these ones will automatically belong to the "cac353_4" group

   permissions     owner       group        location
    drwxrws---    cac353_4   cac353_4      /groups/c/ca_comp353_4
    dr-xrws---    nul-web    cac353_4      /www/groups/c/ca_comp353_4

(The web server initially runs as "nul-web" before switching to "cac353_4".)


If you change the permissions of any directory under these make sure that
the 's' bit is on (use "chmod g+s name_of_subdirectory" to do so). If you
ever get a message that you are over quota please check the permissions of
the directory you are trying to write into.

The server used for the project runs Scientific Linux 7.9
The version of MYSQL in use this term is 8.0.22 and PHP is version 7.4.27

You can run the command "mysql" on any linux machine in the faculty.

Your MYSQL username is cac353_4
The name of the MYSQL server is cac353.encs.concordia.ca
The name of the database you can use is also cac353_4
The password for your database is Tutw23  (case sensitive)
You cannot change this password.


To run mysql use the following:

[login] 101 => mysql -h cac353.encs.concordia.ca -u cac353_4 -p cac353_4
Enter password: Tutw23
